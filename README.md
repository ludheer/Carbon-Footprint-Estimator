# Carbon-Footprint-Estimator
Final impression :The models did a pretty good job, considering we used just basic lifestyle inputs.
Carbon emissions can vary a lot due to many hidden factors we didnâ€™t capture.
Even then, our predictions stayed fairly close to real values across a wide range.
With more detailed inputs, the accuracy can improve even further
